# Javascript code example - settings (add test text at tag)

This is the template for Vanilla JS code examples.

This code example is taken from https://handsontable.com/docs/8.2.0/tutorial-data-binding.html below the title "Working with copy of data". This code example demonstrates using the "settings" prop as a second argument to the Handsontable class.
